            <h1> a) I had to know python in order to accomplish this story. b)Some simple problems arise such as misuse of functions but I solved it by asking Ms. Nguyen c)I like how we were able to be a little creative with creating our story. I like Happy Timmy because it was funny and it taught a life lesson. d) If i were to improve this, I would add more details into the setting.</h1>
